 * In this example, the compiler processes the i input parameter as being of type Object. When the foo method invokes 
 * List.set(int, E), the compiler is not able to confirm the type of object that is being inserted into the list, and an
 * error is produced. When this type of error occurs it typically means that the compiler believes that you are assigning
 * the wrong type to a variable. Generics were added to the Java language for this reason â€” to enforce type safety at 
 * compile time.
